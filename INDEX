data.addTemperatures			Adds a temperature vector to a dataset containing spatial and seasonal phenological information.
data.combine.clusters			Creates a list of station clusters.
data.combine.clusters.search		Searches clusters in a station net.
data.combine				Creates a station net and builds clusters of stations out of it.
data.combine.stationNet			Creates a net of the stations of dataset by checking the distances between the stations.
data.combine.timeseries			Creates combined timeseries out of the dataset by using clusters of stations.
